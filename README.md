Complete Overhaul of Previous Site. Re-created front-end from scratch.

Currently looks best on macbook. I need to scale it to be better viewed on larger screens.

- Added diagonal section. However seems to protrude off the side of page. Need to find a fix or an alternative to make this design.
- Fiddled with jquery animations to make a better interface.
- Major problem with screen scaling. Need to implement vm to font-size to help scale better - will look at it from previous sites made.
